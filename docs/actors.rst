Actors
======


Fact Checker
------------

Gets the facts about a machine.


Prescriber
----------

XXX to be defined


Inspector
---------

The *Inspector* inspects the current state of resources.

It accepts an *Inspection document* conforming to the schema for the given resource type.  It returns an *Observation document* conforming to the schema for the given resource type.

For example, for inspecting the state of the file ``/tmp/foo`` a document such as this would be passed to the appropriate inspector:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "kind": "file",
        "name": "/tmp/foo"
    }

The inspector will return an `Observation document`_ conforming to the file observation schema, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "kind": "file",
        "name": "/tmp/foo",
        "exists": true,
        "size": 3493,
        "sha": "c30a7f7531c41ec102fb5510d58166b502f68437",
        "user": "foo",
        "group": "bar",
        ...
    }


Choreographer
-------------

Takes the facts, prescription, observed state and lays out the steps.


Performer
---------

The *Performer* makes necessary changes to a machine in order to conform to a prescribed state.

It accepts a *Prescription document* conforming to the schema for a given resource.  XXX what it returns is currently undefined.

For example, you might give it this prescription to ensure that the file at ``/tmp/foo`` exists and has attributes described:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "kind": "file",
        "name": "/tmp/foo",
        "exists": true,
        "user": "jim",
        "group": "jimsgroup",
        "content": "This is the content of the file"
    }
